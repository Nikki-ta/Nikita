## About
In this project, we utilized NDVI data and weather data to forecast sugarcane yield in the sugarcane belt districts of Uttar Pradesh. Employing Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), LSTM (Long short-term memory) and Random Forest (RF) models, we computed yield predictions based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine and weather data from the ERA-5 Land dataset by ECMWF (2015-2023). The investigation involved analyzing expected versus actual yields, comparing model performances, and visualizing NDVI time series data annually.

## Problem Statement
Traditional methods of sugarcane yield prediction are time-consuming and often lack accuracy. In the context of extensive research conducted in the field of sugarcane yield prediction, we aim to improve the precision and efficiency of this process. Our approach integrates different machine learning algorithms like MLR, LSTM and RF in combination with meteorological and NDVI data obtained from remote sensing technology. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate yields of Sugarcane fields of the respective Area of Interest. By doing so, we aim to provide sugarcane farmers with a valuable tool for optimizing resource management, enhancing crop productivity, and contributing to sustainable agriculture practices.
